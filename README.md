## Customization

### Colors

The website uses CSS variables for easy theming. Edit the `:root` section in `styles.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #2563eb;
    --primary-dark: #1e40af;
    --secondary-color: #64748b;
    /* ... more variables */
}
```

### Content

- Edit `index.html` to update personal information, experience, publications, etc.
- Modify sections as needed to add or remove content

### Contact Form

The contact form currently shows an alert on submission. To make it functional:

1. Set up a backend service (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms, or your own server)
2. Update the form action in `index.html` or modify the JavaScript in `script.js` to send data to your endpoint
